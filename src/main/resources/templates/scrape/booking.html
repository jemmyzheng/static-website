          <p>Crawling and scraping booking.com can be sometimes hard, specially if you are targetting
            large amount of hotels or reviews. If you ever had to scrape Booking search results,
            you know that they will block your requests and you need to change
            your whole infrastructure to be able to keep getting your data.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the easy to use ProxyCrawl API for crawling, scraping Booking pages and reviews it's very easy
            and convenient.
            Focus on growing and building your company instead of worrying about your infrastructure with out cloud
            API.</p>
