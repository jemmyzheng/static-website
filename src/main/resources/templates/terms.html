        <h3>(A) General disclaimer</h3>
        <h5>(1) Legal information</h5>
        <p>Much of the legal information on this website consists of summaries of complex legal issues. Legal and
          factual details and nuances are inevitably omitted from such summaries. Particular circumstances often
          radically affect the law that applies, and the way that the law applies.</p>
        <p>You should therefore never apply the legal information to your own situation without conducting additional
          research or engaging a lawyer. Nor should you assume that all of the relevant legal material is included on
          our website.</p>
        <p>The law changes constantly, and legal information is always liable to become out-of-date.</p>
        <p>Most of the legal information on this website relates to the laws of United Arab of Emirates and European
          Union law. However, this is not always the case. Do not assume that any particular item of legal information
          relates to any particular jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>For all of these reasons, you must not rely upon any information on this website, and we recommend that you
          take professional legal advice before embarking upon any course of action (or omitting to take any action)
          that has or may have legal implications.</p>
        <h5>(2) Exclusion of warranties, representations and
          guarantees</h5>
        <p>We do not warrant, represent or guarantee:
        <ul>
          <li>the accuracy of the information published on this website;</li>
          <li>the completeness of the information published on this website;</li>
          <li>that the information published on this website is up-to-date;</li>
          <li>or the information on the website can be applied to achieve any particular result.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law we exclude all representations, warranties and
          guarantees relating to this website and the use of this website (including, without limitation, any warranties
          implied by law of satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose and/or the use of reasonable care and skill).</p>
        <h5>(3) Limitations and exclusions of liability</h5>

        <p>To the extent that the website and the information and services on the website are provided, we will not be
          liable for any loss or damage of any nature.

          cases stay marked in our database so we can offer a full refund for that unconsumed content. We don't have a
